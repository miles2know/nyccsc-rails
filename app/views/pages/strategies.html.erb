      <h3>Adaptation</h3>
      <p>Adaptation refers to actions that take place in response to a changing climate. These actions can create opportunities or challenges.  Adaptation strategies can be operational, managerial, budgetary, or involve infrastructure changes that will result in reducing risk and/or taking advantage of potential opportunities associated with climate change. A strategy is usually developed for a key vulnerability. Adaptation strategies do not directly include actions that reduce the likelihood of climate change occurring. </p>

      <h3>Mitigation </h3>
      <p>Mitigation is action taken to reduce the severity of climate change. For example, companies that support employee carpools are mitigating climate change by reducing fossil fuel burning and the related release of carbon dioxide. Early mitigation will make it easier to adapt to climate change at a later time.</p>
